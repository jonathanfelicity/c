# Simple C program
C is a programming language, a general-purpose, procedural, compiled programming
language. C language was created by Dennis Ritchie in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

## What is c used for 
C is often used for so-called systems programming, which is operating systems
programming, application programming, and embedded systems programming, to
name a few.

## C compilers
To compile and run a C program, we need a C compiler. A compiler compiles a C
program and turns the source code into an object file. The linker then links the object
files together and produces an executable file or a library, depending on our intention.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    printf("Hello World");
}
```


* The main function is the application entry point
